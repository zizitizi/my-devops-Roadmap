****practice****  :
container --> save -->.tar --> load --input --> image -->run

to print runiing container name:

docker ps --format {{.Names}}


docker ps -a | awk '(NR>1)'  - display container info without headline

docker ps -a --format "table  {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}"  - retaurn container id and names culomns


crontab -e  - backup script could be here
0 0 * * * /root/script.sh >> /root/backup.log 2>&1    - if we didnot write output here - we should write >>output end of each line in above script


****** one trick if you dont know dockerfile well, you can run an ubuntu container and gitclone and insatll needed app after docker commit ready container and save it as image then push that image to repo and use it as a ready image - as reverse engineering but best practice write dockerfile



# docker volume and storage

to save container data - we can save data in 3 options:

1- volumes  - save data in docker area (/var/lib/docker/) in /volumes/ folder - recommand for persist data
2- bind mounts  - custom directory but limited functionality - 
3- tmpfs mounts  - stored  in hosts memory - least recommanded- for very high speed compute container (microsecend- dataanalyse-big data) - 


mostly use volumes and bind mounts -

docker file system - storage driver - change file system block in sectors - in ext4 512 B - 
in linux we have - ext4 (default in debian) - xfs (default in RHEL)  - zfs (default in mac)  - btrfs - ..... 
windows file system - fat32 - ntfs


to see filesystem in linux use df command
df -h   -  human readable df

df -Th   - human readable df with type of fs

docker file system is :

overlay2  - defaults for docker fs
btrfs & zfs
vfs
aufs
devicemapper  - for lvm
overlay  - old linux efor ,inux 3

docker file system defaults is overlay2

docker info - see docker fs


#### important note: if you have 1 t stroage for infra to devops, when install linux server give partion size 300 to / and 700 to /var/,  lack of enough space to /var/ cause server crash. 
all apps like kuber and jenkins , ... uses /var/ to work. If all the storage space is occupied by Docker the serverwould be crashes.
