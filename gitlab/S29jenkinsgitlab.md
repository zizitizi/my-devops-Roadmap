CD/CD :


every where we use gitlab . but for wondows app and .net base application azure devops recommanded that have good fature for it.

but .netcore that announce in 2016 in can insyall on linux and use in docker image. then we use for all purpose gitlab . but in some company they force to use windows app we use azure devops.but usually:
